# Cursor AI Configuration for Design System RTE

## Project Overview
This is a monorepo containing a design system with React and Angular implementations, plus design documentation.

## Code Style & Standards
- Follow the existing ESLint and Prettier configurations
- Use TypeScript for type safety
- Maintain consistency across React and Angular packages
- Follow component-based architecture patterns

## Project Structure
- `packages/react/` - React implementation of design system
- `packages/angular/` - Angular implementation of design system  
- `packages/core/` - Shared core utilities and types
- `packages/design-docs/` - Storybook documentation

## Development Guidelines
- When creating components, ensure they work across both React and Angular
- Update both implementations when making changes to shared components
- Run tests for both platforms: `npm run test:react` and `npm run test:angular`
- Use the changeset workflow for versioning: `npm run changeset:add`

## AI Assistance Preferences
- Suggest improvements that maintain cross-platform compatibility
- Prioritize accessibility and design system consistency
- When suggesting new features, consider impact on both React and Angular packages
- Always use explicit return typing to functions when I ask for a refactor in Angular
<!-- - Help maintain documentation in sync with code changes  -->
